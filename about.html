    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Jeanpierre da Costa Antunes, and I am a 20-year-old front-end developer passionate about creating exceptional digital experiences. Originally from Brazil, I currently reside in Fundão, Portugal, where I am pursuing a professional course in programming at the Escola Profissional do Fundão.</p>
    
    <p>My journey into programming began several years ago, and I have since honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am deeply committed to staying current with the latest technologies and trends to deliver top-notch solutions to my clients and projects.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to front-end development, I have a keen interest in interface design and usability. I believe that a well-crafted design is crucial for providing a seamless and enjoyable user experience.</p>
    
    <p>When I am not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, learning about innovations in the tech world, or collaborating on open-source projects. I am always eager to take on new challenges and grow both personally and professionally.</p>
    
    <p>If you are looking for a dedicated and creative developer for your next project, feel free to get in touch with me!</p>
